## Overview

[![Project Overview](/public/img/pinderiku-streamer-overview.jpg)](https://pinderiku.vercel.app/)

*Live demo can be found [here](https://pinderiku.vercel.app/).*

I made this project because I wanted to host the songs for my hobby musical project on an independent platform. While doing it I managed to improve my skills in Typescript, and TailwindCSS, since I was not familiarized with these as much as I was with the other technologies used.

There are a couple of little things that I was able to implement that were pretty cool:

- The Waveform.

For this I used a package name [Wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer.xyz/), highly customized by myself for this project.

- The Sound Frequency Bars.

For these I used two animated HTML canvas, mirrored vertically, to show the frequencies of the playing song.

## Features

At the moment the application only supports streaming of songs for one artist. Although it has support to sign in and register, these only allow the logged in user to like songs. I intend on expanding the app with more functionalities in the future, like the creation of playlists of each user.
